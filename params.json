With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and makes the \"works on my machine\" excuse a relic of the past.\r\nVagrant uses Oracleâ€™s VirtualBox to build configurable, lightweight, and portable virtual machines dynamically. \r\nYou can learn more from its website [http://www.vagrant.com/](http://www.vagrant.com/).\r\n\r\n## How do I install Vagrant?\r\nPlease read carefully the Vagrant docs in [http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html](http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html).\r\n\r\n## How do I install Fabric in my compute?\r\nPlease read the Fabric documentation in [http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.6/#installation](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.6/#installation).\r\n\r\n## OMG, another deployment tool for Openstack????\r\nRelax. This is how StackOps deploys and manages Openstack clouds. There are really cool tools our there, but we think we have to focus in doing things simpler and easier. And Fabric really helps.\r\nWe think the Openstack community suffers of the 'Golden Hammer' syndrome about all these nice deployment toos. FABuloso only does what it does, and it does it very well.\r\n\r\n## What license do you use?\r\nApache 2.0 license, of course.\r\n\r\n## This looks cool! Can I colaborate?\r\nSure, just push it.\r\n\r\n## What version of Openstack is supported?\r\nRight now Folsom Stable. Just check the branches to see different versions. Obvioulsy this will change.\r\n\r\n# Deployment example of a single node on Vagrant\r\n\r\n## Install fabric\r\n\r\nThis example assumes you are using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or newer.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsudo apt-get install fabric\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Vagrant\r\n\r\nCreate the  directory where you want to create your vagrant environment. For example:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir fabuloso\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Download our test box\r\nGo to the directory that you have crated and download the stackops box\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncd fabuloso/\r\nvagrant box add stackops-distro-base-v2 https://dl.dropbox.com/u/527582/stackops-distro-base-v2.box\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Download the FABuloso repository in the same directory\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone git@github.com:StackOps/fabuloso.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run the box stackops-distro-base-v2\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Execute singlenode.sh file to configurate your box.\r\n\r\nThis can take a while.\r\n```shell\r\n./singlenode.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Running FABuloso in other operating Systems. Bootstrapping\r\n\r\n## Installation script\r\nThe scripts needs some basic configuration to work:\r\n* An openssh-server installed\r\n* The stackops user without password and member of the sudo group\r\n* A public key. With the scripts comes a non secure private/public key combo for default installation. Please change it asap.\r\n\r\nThe bootstrap script for any OS with a Bourne shell is very simple. You can use it like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nwget -O - https://raw.github.com/StackOps/fabuloso/master/bootstrap/init.sh | sudo sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n##  Configuring the network\r\n\r\nDepending on the component type, you will have to configure the network with different number of interfaces and configurations.\r\n","google":"UA-21651960-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
