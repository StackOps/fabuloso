FABuloso: OpenStack deployments
===============================

**FABuloso** is a python tool to easily organize and deploy an `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org>`_ architecture using `Fabric <http://docs.fabfile.org/>`_. *FABuloso* manages configuration with **components** within **catalogs**. For a more deeper insight about what *FABuloso* does and how it does, take a look at the diagram bellow and the :ref:`introduction <introduction>` page, where we explain the different parts that build *FABuloso*.
