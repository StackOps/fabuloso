Catalogs
========

A **catalog** in *FABuloso* is a collection of *components* with certain characteristics in common. For example, a sample catalog could be *folsom* which would contain all the components needed to deploy OpenStack Folsom.

.. warning::

    Currently we only manage *catalogs* as git repositories. In the future more options will be supported.
